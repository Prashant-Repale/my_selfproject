      "Todd is a small boy in the town of Rocksville. Todd thinks his town is the best place in the world, and out of all the places in Rocksville, Todd loves to play in Lake Keet the most. Lake Keet is a small lake with fish, plants, and even little shells. Todd's favorite part was the big rock in the middle of the lake. Todd lives pretty close to the lake, so he gets to go there a lot, but could never to get to the rock in the middle. Todd's dad never lets him swim too far because Todd can't swim very well.\\newlineDuring summer, Todd told his dad that he wanted to get to the rock before break ended. Todd's dad told him he had to try his hardest. If he did, then Todd's dad would watch him swim every day. If Todd wanted to try and get to the rock, his dad would follow him there to make sure he was safe. Todd's dad wrote this down in his notebook so he wouldn't forget.\\newlineAfter a week, Todd made his first try to get to the rock, and his dad followed him like he said he would. Todd didn't make it to the rock before he got tired and had to turn around. He practiced even harder for the next two weeks and wanted to try again. So, a month after summer started, Todd tried to reach the rock again. This time, Todd gave it his all and got all the way to the rock. He was very happy, and his dad was very proud of his son's hard work. To celebrate, Todd's dad carved Todd's name and the date into a tree. This way, they would always remember Todd's hard work.\n",
